### v2.14.0

Update to add support for `graphql@0.12`, and drop versions before `0.11` from the peer dependencies list. The `graphql` package has some breaking changes you might need to be aware of, but there aren't any breaking changes in `graphql-tools` itself, or common usage patterns, so we are shipping this as a minor version. We're also running tests on this package with _both_ `graphql@0.11` and `graphql@0.12` until we confirm most users have updated.

- Visit the [`graphql` releases page](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/releases) to keep track of for breaking changes to the underlying package.
